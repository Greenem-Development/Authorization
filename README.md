# Authorization
A minecraft plugin for unofficial servers. It adds authorization for players which allows them to get access to their account data on the server only after logging in.
It does A LOT of work, I can't remember all of the little things even if I wanted.
Basically it's already almost in release state, but I'm working on some things to make the plugin easy to use for everyone.

Known things "to do":
- Add encryption to the passwords storage. Sounds obvious, but I was focusing on more interesting features.
- Currently there is no "permissions" settings provided by Bukkit API, though a lot of people like using them. Sorry, lol, I was doing everything with just usual files
